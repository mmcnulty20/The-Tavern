As you push your way through the patrons to an unoccupied table, your adventuring companions cluster in behind you. It's been a rough day: a quest was abandoned, your rogue tried and conspicuously failed to steal a priceless artifact, and somewhere a distressed damsel remains **decidedly** un-saved. But there's nothing you can do about any of that now. By all the Gods, you need a drink.*",
